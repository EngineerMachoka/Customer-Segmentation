Segment customers based on quantity and total spent using K-Means clustering.



\## 🧠 Project Summary



This project performs customer segmentation using transaction data from an online retail store. It analyzes customer behavior by calculating total spending and quantity purchased per customer, then applies \*\*KMeans clustering\*\* to group customers into distinct segments.



Key steps include:

\- Reading and cleaning data from an Excel file

\- Aggregating total spend and purchase quantity per customer

\- Scaling the data for effective clustering

\- Applying \*\*KMeans\*\* to identify customer segments

\- Visualizing the segments with scatter plots

\- Saving the results for further analysis



📊 This helps identify customer patterns such as high spenders, bulk buyers, and potential churners — useful for marketing, loyalty programs, or targeting campaigns.
